## Errors in Formula Output

The following is a list of common errors you may see in the output of your formulas and how to solve them.

- `No data.` - This actually isn't an error, but it is one of the most common messages. It means Market Data does not have any data for the symbol you input. Try a different symbol or a different timeframe.
- `Missing Token.` - You haven't yet added your token in the Market Data sidebar. Open the side bar in Extensions > Market Data > Start and add your token to the sheet.
- `Unable to start a Market Data session with sidebar closed.` - This error occurs when you first open your sheet for the day. Open the side bar in Extensions > Market Data > Start and refresh your data using one of the refresh options provided.
