The Market Data API is designed around REST and supports standard HTTP response codes and methods. All responses are delivered via JSON for programmatic use of the information or via CSV files to load into your preferred spreadsheet application.

## Try Our API

The easiest way to try out our API is using our [Swagger User Interface](https://api.marketdata.app/), which will allow you to try out your API requests directly from your browser.

:::tip
Our endpoints have **lots of optional parameters** to allow users to sort and filter responses. It can be overwhelming to new users at first. When you're first getting started with our API, just scroll to the required parameters and ignore all the optional ones.
