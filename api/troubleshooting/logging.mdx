## Why Logging is Important

Logging our API's responses is crucial for monitoring the behavior of your application and troubleshooting problems.

## What Should Be Logged

For the Market Data API, log any response that doesn't have a 2xx status code. Market Data responds to successful requests with either a 200 or 203 status code. Successful responses may be logged if you wish, but normally this is not necessary.

When logging errors, the log should include the exact request made, Market Data's response, and the CF-Ray header.

# Logging in Different Languages

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="NodeJS" label="NodeJS">

```

```js title="logger.js"
const axios = require('axios');
const fs = require('fs');

// Make the API request
axios.get('https://api.marketdata.app/v1/your_endpoint_here')
  .then(response => {
    // Do nothing for successful responses
  })
  .catch(error => {
    if (error.response.status !== 200 && error.response.status !== 203) {
      const logData = {
        request: error.config.method.toUpperCase() + ' ' + error.config.url,
        response: error.response.data,
        cfRayHeader: error.response.headers['cf-ray'] || 'Not available'
      };
      // Save to a logfile
      fs.appendFileSync('api_error_log.json', JSON.stringify(logData) + '\n');
    }
  });
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Python" label="Python">

```

```python title="logger.py"
import requests
import json

# Make the API request
response = requests.get("https://api.marketdata.app/v1/any_endpoint_here")

# Check if the response is not 200 or 203
if response.status_code not in [200, 203]:
    log_data = {
        "request": response.request.method + " " + response.request.url,
        "response": response.content.decode("utf-8"),
        "cf_ray_header": response.headers.get("CF-Ray", "Not available")
    }
    # Save to a logfile
    with open("api_error_log.json", "a") as logfile:
        logfile.write(json.dumps(log_data) + "\n")
```

## Logging in NodeJS

### Installation Requirements

- NodeJS
- `axios` library

### Sample Code


# Special Considerations

## The CF-Ray Header

### What is the CF-Ray Header

The CF-Ray header (otherwise known as a Ray ID) is a hashed value that encodes information about the Cloudflare data center and the visitorâ€™s request.

### Why It's Important

When opening a ticket at the customer helpdesk, if a Ray ID is provided to our support staff, we'll be able to identify the request and find why it produced an error.

# Opening a Support Ticket

## When to Open a Ticket

Open a ticket if you experience persistent issues or errors that cannot be resolved through logging.

## What to Include

Include the log data and the CF-Ray header value for faster resolution.

# Conclusion

Proper logging is essential for maintaining a healthy interaction with APIs. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that you're well-equipped to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
