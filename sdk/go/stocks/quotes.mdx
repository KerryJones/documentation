}
```

StockQuotesResponse encapsulates the data structure for responses received from stock quote requests. It contains arrays for various stock attributes such as symbols, prices, volumes, and timestamps.

#### Generated By

- <a href="#StockQuoteRequest.Packed">`StockQuoteRequest.Packed()`</a>

  Makes a StoStockQuoteRequest and returns a StockQuotesResponse.


#### Methods

- <a href="#StockQuote.String">`String()`</a>

  Returns a string representation of the StockQuotesResponse.

- <a href="#StockQuotesResponse.Unpack">`Unpack()`</a>

  Transforms the StockQuotesResponse into a slice of StockQuote structs.


#### Notes

- The Change, ChangePct, High52, and Low52 fields are pointers to accommodate nil values, indicating that the data may not be applicable or available for some stocks.



<a name="StockQuotesResponse.String"></a>
### String

```go
func (sqr *StockQuotesResponse) String() string
```

String constructs and returns a string representation of a StockQuotesResponse, encapsulating all relevant details of stock quotes including symbol, ask, bid, mid, last, change, change percentage, 52\-week high, 52\-week low, volume, and updated time. This method is primarily used for generating a human\-readable summary of stock quotes response, which can be useful for logging, debugging, or displaying stock information in a textual format.

#### Returns

- `string`

  A comprehensive, human\-readable string representation of the stock quotes response.


#### Notes

- Optional fields such as change, change percentage, 52\-week high, and 52\-week low are included in the string only if they are available.

<a name="StockQuotesResponse.Unpack"></a>
### Unpack

```go
func (sqr *StockQuotesResponse) Unpack() ([]StockQuote, error)
```

Unpack transforms a StockQuotesResponse into a slice of StockQuote structs, effectively unpacking the bulk response into individual stock quotes. This method is primarily used to convert a grouped response of stock quotes into a more accessible format, where each stock quote is represented as a separate struct. It is particularly useful for scenarios where individual stock details need to be accessed or manipulated.

#### Returns

- `[]StockQuote`

  A slice of StockQuote structs representing the unpacked stock quotes.

- `error`

  An error if any issues occur during the unpacking process. Currently, this implementation always returns nil for error.


#### Notes

- This method handles optional fields such as Change, ChangePct, High52, and Low52 by checking for their existence before assignment, allowing for a flexible unpacking process that accommodates incomplete data.








<a name="StockQuote"></a>
## StockQuote

<a name="StockQuote.String"></a>
### String

```go
func (sq StockQuote) String() string
```

String generates a string representation of the StockQuote struct, providing a human\-readable summary of a stock's details. This method is particularly useful for displaying stock information in a format that is easy to read and understand.
