Market Data's Go SDK offers custom structs tailored to simplify interactions with the Markets endpoints. These structs act as an easy-to-use interface, hiding the complexity of HTTP request and response processes.

## Markets Endpoints

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
