The [Market Data Go Client](<https://www.marketdata.app/docs/sdk/go/client>) includes functionality for making API requests, handling responses, managing rate limits, and logging. The SDK supports various data types including stocks, options, indices, and market status information.

### Get Started Quickly with the MarketDataClient

1. Use [GetClient](<#GetClient>) to fetch the [MarketDataClient](<#MarketDataClient>) instance and set the API token.
2. Turn on Debug mode to log detailed request and response information to disk as you learn how to use the SDK.
3. Make a test request.
4. Check the rate limit in the client to keep track of your requests.
5. Check the in\-memory logs to see the raw request and response details.


<a name="GetLogs"></a>
## GetLogs

```go
func GetLogs() *logging.HttpRequestLogs
```

GetLogs retrieves a pointer to the HttpRequestLogs instance, allowing access to the logs collected during HTTP requests. This method is primarily used for debugging and monitoring purposes, providing insights into the HTTP request lifecycle and any issues that may have occurred.

### Returns

- \*logging.HttpRequestLogs: A pointer to the HttpRequestLogs instance containing logs of HTTP requests.

<a name="NewClient"></a>
## NewClient

```go
func NewClient(token string) error
```

New creates and configures a new MarketDataClient instance with default settings. This method is primarily used to initialize a client with predefined configurations such as the default rate limit reset time, production environment setup, and common HTTP headers and hooks. It's the starting point for interacting with the MarketDataClient functionalities.

### Returns

- \*MarketDataClient: A pointer to the newly created MarketDataClient instance with default configurations applied.

<a name="Environment"></a>
## Environment

```go
type Environment string
```

Environment represents the type for different environments in which the MarketDataClient can operate. Customers do not need to set the environment. The [MarketDataClient](<#MarketDataClient>) will automatically be initialized with a Production environment if no environment is set.

Market Data's Go Client supports three environments:

1. Production
2. Test
3. Development.

It is used to configure the client to point to the appropriate base URL depending on the environment. This is used for development or testing by Market Data employees.



<a name="Production"></a>

```go
const (
    // Production specifies the production environment. It is used when the client is interacting with the live Market Data API.
    Production Environment = "prod"

    // Test specifies the testing environment. It is used for testing purposes, allowing interaction with a sandbox version of the Market Data API.
    Test Environment = "test"

    // Development specifies the development environment. It is typically used during the development phase, pointing to a local or staged version of the Market Data API.
    Development Environment = "dev"
)
```

<a name="MarketDataClient"></a>
## MarketDataClient

```go
type MarketDataClient struct {
    *resty.Client                // Embedding resty.Client to utilize its HTTP client functionalities.
    RateLimitLimit     int       // RateLimitLimit represents the maximum number of requests that can be made in a rate limit window.
    RateLimitRemaining int       // RateLimitRemaining tracks the number of requests that can still be made before hitting the rate limit.
    RateLimitReset     time.Time // RateLimitReset indicates the time when the rate limit will be reset.
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

MarketDataClient struct defines the structure for the MarketData client instance. It embeds the resty.Client to inherit the HTTP client functionalities. Additionally, it includes fields for managing rate limits and synchronization, as well as an error field for capturing any errors that occur during API calls. The debug field is used to control logging verbosity.

#### Setter Methods

- <a href="#MarketDataClient.Debug">`Debug(bool)`</a>

  Enables or disables debug mode for logging detailed request and response information.

- <a href="#MarketDataClient.Environment">`Environment(Environment)`</a>

  Sets the environment for the MarketDataClient.

- <a href="#MarketDataClient.Timeout">`Timeout(int)`</a>

  Sets the request timeout for the MarketDataClient.

- <a href="#MarketDataClient.Token">`Token(string) error`</a>

  Sets the authentication token for the MarketDataClient.


#### Methods

- <a href="#MarketDataClient.RateLimitExceeded">`RateLimitExceeded() bool`</a>

  Checks if the rate limit for API requests has been exceeded.

- <a href="#MarketDataClient.String">`String() string`</a>

  Generates a formatted string that represents the MarketDataClient instance.




<a name="GetClient"></a>
### GetClient

```go
func GetClient() (*MarketDataClient, error)
```

GetClient checks for an existing instance of MarketDataClient and returns it. If the client is not already initialized, it attempts to initialize it.

#### Returns

- `*MarketDataClient`

  A pointer to the existing or newly initialized MarketDataClient instance.

- `error`

  An error object if the client cannot be initialized.


<a name="MarketDataClient.Debug"></a>
### Debug

```go
func (c *MarketDataClient) Debug(enable bool)
```

Debug enables or disables debug mode for the MarketDataClient. When debug mode is enabled, the client logs detailed request and response information, which can be useful for development and troubleshooting.

#### Parameters

- `bool`

  A boolean value indicating whether to enable or disable debug mode.


<a name="MarketDataClient.Environment"></a>
### Environment

```go
func (c *MarketDataClient) Environment(env Environment) error
```

Environment configures the base URL of the MarketDataClient based on the provided environment string. This method allows the client to switch between different environments such as production, testing, and development.

#### Parameters

- `string`

  A string representing the environment to configure. Accepted values are "prod", "test", and "dev".


#### Returns

- `*MarketDataClient`

  A pointer to the \*MarketDataClient instance with the configured environment. This allows for method chaining.


If an invalid environment is provided, the client's Error field is set, and the same instance is returned.

<a name="MarketDataClient.RateLimitExceeded"></a>
### RateLimitExceeded

```go
func (c *MarketDataClient) RateLimitExceeded() bool
```

RateLimitExceeded checks if the rate limit for API requests has been exceeded. It returns true if the number of remaining requests is less than or equal to zero and the current time is before the rate limit reset time, indicating that the client must wait before making further requests. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating that the client can continue making requests.

#### Returns

- `bool`

  A boolean value indicating whether the rate limit has been exceeded.


<a name="MarketDataClient.String"></a>
### String

```go
func (c *MarketDataClient) String() string
```

String generates a formatted string that represents the MarketDataClient instance, including its environment, rate limit information, and the rate limit reset time. This method is useful for quickly obtaining a textual summary of the client's current state, particularly for logging or debugging purposes.

#### Returns

- `string`

  A formatted string containing the client's environment, rate limit information, and rate limit reset time.


<a name="MarketDataClient.Timeout"></a>
### Timeout

```go
func (c *MarketDataClient) Timeout(seconds int) *MarketDataClient
```

Timeout sets the request timeout for the MarketDataClient.

This method allows users to specify a custom timeout duration for all HTTP requests made by the client. The timeout duration is specified in seconds. Setting a timeout helps in preventing indefinitely hanging requests in case of network issues or slow server responses.

#### Parameters

- `int`

  The timeout duration in seconds. A duration of 0 means no timeout. By default the client has a timeout of 95 seconds.


#### Returns

- `*MarketDataClient`

  A pointer to the MarketDataClient instance, allowing for method chaining.


<a name="MarketDataClient.Token"></a>
### Token

```go
func (c *MarketDataClient) Token(bearerToken string) error
```

Token configures the authentication token for the MarketDataClient. This method sets the authentication scheme to "Bearer" and assigns the provided bearerToken for subsequent requests. It also makes an initial request to the MarketData API to authorize the token and fetch rate limit information.

#### Parameters

- `string`

  A string representing the bearer token to be used for API requests.


#### Returns

- `error`

  An error if the authorization was not successful or nil if it was.


#### Notes

If an error occurs during the initial authorization request or if the response indicates a failure, the client remains unmodified. The token will only be set if authorization is successful.
