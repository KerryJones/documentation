The Go SDK provides a set of custom structs designed to facilitate access to the Indices endpoints. These structs serve as a convenient interface for Go developers to interact with the specified endpoints, abstracting the underlying HTTP request and response handling.

## Indicies Endpoints

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
