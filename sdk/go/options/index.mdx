The Go SDK from Market Data simplifies how you work with Options endpoints by using custom structs. These structs make it easier to handle HTTP requests and responses.

## Options Endpoints

import DocCardList from "@theme/DocCardList";
import { useCurrentSidebarCategory } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items} />
