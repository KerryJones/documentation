title: Authentication

The Market Data API uses a **Bearer Token** for authentication. The token is required for each request you make to the API. Your token should have been e-mailed to you when you first signed up for an account.  If you do not have a token or have lost your sign-up email, request a new token from the [Market Data Dashboard](https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard/). 

There are two ways to set your token when using the Go SDK:

1. Set it from an environment variable _(recommended)_
2. Hardcode it in your code

On startup, the SDK will look for the environment variable. If found, it will create a new default client and use the token for all requests. If the environment variable is not found on start-up, you will need to create a client manually and set the token at runtime.

:::tip
When your code is running in a production environment, we recommend using an environment variable to ensure your token is not stored with your code. This is the most secure way to set your token.

## How To Set-Up The Environment Variable

Set the token in the environment variable `MARKETDATA_TOKEN`. Alternatively, you can hardcode it in your code, but please be aware that this is not secure and could pose a risk if your code is shared.

### Set The Variable In The Console
```bash
export MARKETDATA_TOKEN="your_api_token"   # mac/linux
setx MARKETDATA_TOKEN "your_api_token"     # windows
```

After setting the variable, build and run your code to make a test request. If you have set the variable correctly, you should see the output of the test request. If you see an error, double-check that you have set the variable correctly.

### Make A Test Request

Use the following test code to verify that your authentication is working by making a test request to SPY or any other symbol that requires authentication. Do not use AAPL to test your authentication because AAPL is a free test symbol and will return data even if you are not authenticated properly.

```go

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"

  api "github.com/MarketDataApp/sdk-go"
)

func main() {
  // Initialize a new request, set the symbol parameter, make the request.
	quotes, err := api.StockQuote().Symbol("SPY").Get() 
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to get stock quotes: %v", err)
	}

  // Loop over the quotes and print them out.
  for _, quote := range quotes {
		fmt.Println(quote)
	}
}

```

If your token is set correctly, you should see the output of the test request.

## How To Create a Client Manually and Assign a Token

If you decide to create a client manually and assign a token at runtime, you simply embed the token in your code somewhere and pass it to the GetClient function. This is not recommended for production code.

### Example Code

```go

package main

import (
  "log"
  "fmt"

  api "github.com/MarketDataApp/sdk-go"
)

func main() {
	// replace with your token
	token := "your_token_here"		

	// create a new client and set the token
	client, err := api.GetClient(token) 
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to get client: %v", err)
	}

	// make a test request to SPY
	quotes, err := api.StockQuote().Symbol("SPY").Get() 
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to get stock quotes: %v", err)
	}
	
	// print out the response
    for _, quote := range quotes {
		fmt.Println(quote)
	}
}

```

## Next Steps

After successful authentication, you will be able to begin making requests to the Market Data API. We recommend reading the brief overview of how the client works, so you can get familiar with interacting with the SDK. The SDK includes structs for each endpoint as well as methods that allow you to retrieve data. Use any of the endpoints in the SDK to make requests to the API.
