Market Data offers two ways for users to use our service for free. We offer the "Free Forever" plan, which allows for 100 API requests per day. We also offer a free 30 day trial (no credit card required) so that users can test our services and determine which plan best meets their needs. 

## Delayed Data

Trial accounts work exactly the same as paid accounts and have the same [plan limits](/accounts-billing/plan-limits). The only difference with trial accounts is that all data is delayed (usually by at least 15 minutes). We supply data to both Free Forever and free trial accounts on a "best effort" basis.
