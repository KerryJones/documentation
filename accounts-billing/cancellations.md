Your Market Data account can be cancelled at any time via our online ticketing system. Simply open a billing issue ticket in the [Customer Dashboard](https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard/) requesting cancellation and your account will be cancelled.

## Unused Time

When you cancel a paid subscription, you will continue to have access until the renewal date. Feel free to continue to utilize Market Data's services until that time.

## Restarting a Cancelled Subscription

If your subscription has not yet expired, you may be able to restart it. Open a Billing ticket in the [Customer Dashboard](https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard/) and we'll reverse your cancellation. This will allow billing to continue and ensure uninterrupted access to Market Data. If Market Data pricing has changed, restarting an unexpired subscription will allow you to maintain your previous plan's pricing.

If your subscription has already expired, it cannot be restarted. Please make a new purchase and a new subscription will be created for your account. It is important to note that once a subscription has expired, any new subscription will always be made using the current pricing.
