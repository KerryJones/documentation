3. Navigate to the "Subscriptions" tab on the left sidebar.
4. Select your Market Data subscription and cancel it.
5. You will receive a confirmation email once your subscription has been cancelled.

:::tip
If your decision to cancel is due to technical issues, missing features, or any other reason, we invite you to first open a support ticket in the [Customer Dashboard](https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard/) before cancelling. Our team is here to help and we will do everything we can to resolve your issue and make sure you're happy with Market Data.

## Unused Time

When you cancel a paid subscription, you will continue to have access to Market Data until your account's renewal date. Feel free to continue utilizing Market Data's services until that time. After the renewal date passes, you will not lose access. Your account will immediately revert to a `Free Forever` subscription, allowing you to continue making 100 API calls or 100 Sheets formulas per day.

## Restarting a Cancelled Subscription

If your subscription has not yet expired, you may be able to restart it. Open a Billing ticket in the [Customer Dashboard](https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard/) and we'll reverse your cancellation. This will allow billing to continue and ensure uninterrupted access to Market Data. If Market Data pricing has changed, restarting an unexpired subscription will allow you to maintain your previous plan's pricing.

If your subscription has already expired, it cannot be restarted. Please make a new purchase and a new subscription will be created for your account. It is important to note that once a subscription has expired, any new subscription will always be made using the current pricing.
