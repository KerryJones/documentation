For heightened security, Market Data uses an independent third-party billing system to process your transactions. We do not store your credit card information and we do not have access to your billing details. Customers can manage their own subscriptions and billing details via the [Billing Portal](https://cc.payproglobal.com/Customer/Account/Login). 

## How to Access the Billing Portal for the First Time

To access your billing information for the first time, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Billing Portal](https://cc.payproglobal.com/Customer/Account/Login).
2. Since it's your first time, you'll need to set up a password. Click on the "Forgot Password" link to initiate this process. Please note that the [Billing Portal](https://cc.payproglobal.com/Customer/Account/Login) operates independently from your Market Data account, meaning your Market Data credentials will not work here.
3. After setting your password, log in with your new credentials.
4. You will now be able to view and manage your billing details and subscriptions.

## Actions You Can Take in the Billing Portal

The [Billing Portal](https://cc.payproglobal.com/Customer/Account/Login) allows you to take any of the following actions:

- View your order details
- Generate a PDF invoice for your subscription charges
- Update your credit card information
- Add a back-up credit card
- Request billing support
- Cancel your subscription

## Billing Support

You can also request assistance with billing-related issues after logging-in to the [Billing Portal](https://cc.payproglobal.com/Customer/Account/Login). Customers request assistance via:

- Support ticket
- Online chat
- Schedule a call-back

### Limitations of Billing Support

Please be aware that billing support staff can only assist you with billing-related questions. For technical issues, API troubleshooting, assistance with Sheets formulas, etc., please open a support ticket in the Market Data [Customer Dashboard](https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard/).

Billing staff cannot assist with custom quotes, student discounts, or other special billing requests. For these types of inquiries, please contact our sales team via the Market Data [Customer Dashboard](https://www.marketdata.app/dashboard/).
