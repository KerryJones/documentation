Market Data is thrilled to introduce a **30-day free trial** of our Trader Plan, no credit card required. This trial is crafted to allow users to experience the capabilities of the Trader Plan, ensuring it aligns with their high-volume data needs before making a subscription commitment. Here's an overview of what the Trader Trial Plan entails.

## What You Get with the Trader Trial

- **100,000 API Credits per Day**: Test the limits with a substantial increase in daily API requests, catering to the most demanding projects.
- **Delayed Data**: Access to data that is typically delayed by at least 15 minutes, provided on a "best effort" basis.
- **Full Historical Data Access**: Explore our extensive historical data archives with no restrictions, perfect for deep analysis and comprehensive backtesting.
- **Premium Endpoints (AAPL Ticker)**: Dive into our premium endpoints using the AAPL ticker for a taste of our detailed fundamental data, including earnings insights.

## Features of the Trader Trial

The Trader Trial Plan offers a glimpse into the full capabilities of the Trader Plan with some tailored differences:

- **Duration**: Enjoy a full 30 days to explore and evaluate the features of the Trader Plan, ensuring it meets your high-volume data needs.
- **No Credit Card Required**: Begin your trial with no financial commitment, allowing for a risk-free exploration of our highest-tier services.
- **Full Access with Limitations**: While the trial provides access to many features akin to the paid Trader Plan, it's designed for evaluation and not as a complete substitute.

## What You Don't Get With the Trader Trial

- **Real-Time Data**: Real-time data access is not included in the trial. Subscription to any paid Market Data Plan immediately upgrades your data feed to real-time.
- **Premium Endpoints (All Tickers)**: Full access to our premium endpoints across all tickers is reserved for paying customers only.
