Due to Google's strict quota on urlfetch requests, unwanted refreshing of cells can become troublesome. Google will refresh your spreadsheet if any of the following take place:

- Reopening a spreadsheet
- Adding/deleting a row
- Adding/deleting a column
- Sorting a row/column

## Add-ons, Scripts & Macros

If you have other add-ons, scripts, or macros that perform any cell or row actions such as those listed above, your sheet may recaculate excessively, causing you to hit the urlfetch quota very quickly. We recommend disabling them.
