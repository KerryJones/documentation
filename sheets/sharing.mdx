title: Sharing Your Sheet
sidebar_position: 8
---

It is possible to share you sheet with other users by using the **Share** button in the top right corner of the sheet. You can share the sheet with anyone who has a Google account. The only requirement is that each user who receives a copy of your sheet must have the [Market Data Add-on](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/market_data/453586334945) installed from the Google Workspace Marketplace.

:::warning
When you share your spreadsheet with other users, the functions that execute will use the token you have stored in the sheet. Sharing allows other users to make requests in the sheet using your token, but those users will not be able to see the token that you have stored in the sheet. Share your sheet only with users whom you trust.

## Sharing Mode

You must share your sheet in **Edit** mode to allow a user to open the sidebar and execute the formulas. If you share your sheet in **View** or **Comment** mode, the Market Data formulas will not execute because the user will not have access to the sidebar.
